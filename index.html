      <p>Kerala enjoys three major seasons – summer, monsoon and winter.

        Summer begins in March and ends in May, and winter begins around November and remains until February. Monsoon
        season in Kerala comes twice a year. Southwest monsoon, from June to August, is the main rainy season. And
        Northeast monsoon, also known as the retreating monsoon, comes around October-November.

        Between the two monsoon seasons, the temperature remains cool in most parts of Kerala.

        It is a tropical land with, generally, pleasant climate. But the climate differs from place to place. While the
        high mountainous regions remain cool throughout the year, the plains and coastal areas experience hot and humid
        climates. Also, you can expect occasional showers any time during the year.

        Given below is more information about the climate of Kerala and Kerala tourist season, so that you can know the
        best time to plan a trip and explore the attractions.</p>

        locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual basis. Temples that can afford it will
        usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. The idol in the temple is
        taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant. When the procession visits homes around the
        temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it.Processions often include
        traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam. Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated by the
        Muslim community of the state while the festivals like Christmas and Easter are observed by the Christians.</p>
